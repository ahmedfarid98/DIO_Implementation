# DIO_Implementation
A Digital Input Output is a peripheral that deals with digital signals, either by generating a digital signal (Output Mode) or by receiving it (Input Mode).
The basic block unit for the DIO pin is the Tri-State Buffer. Any DIO pin is consisting of a Tri-State buffer as a main component. The Tri-State buffer controls the direction of the data, A to B or B to A.
I use this DIO with Microcontroller AVR Atmega32. It has 32 DIO pins grouped as following:
1- PORTA has 8 DIO Pins from A0 to A7
2- PORTB has 8 DIO Pins from B0 to B8
3- PORTC has 8 DIO Pins from C0 to C8
4- PORTD has 8 DIO Pins from D0 to D8
